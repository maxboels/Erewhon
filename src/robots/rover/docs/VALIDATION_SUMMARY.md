## PWM Values Analysis

### Steering ‚úì Good Range
- **Using:** 1208 ‚Üí 1948 Œºs
- **Spec range:** 1065 ‚Üí 1959 Œºs  
- **Coverage:** 83% of full servo range
- **Balance:** Well centered (avg: -0.012)
- **Distribution:** 80% center, 6% left, 14% right

### Throttle ‚ö†Ô∏è Conservative
- **Using:** 0 ‚Üí 18.5% duty cycle
- **Spec range:** 0 ‚Üí 70% duty cycle
- **Coverage:** Only 26% of available throttle
- **Average:** 13% duty cycle
- **Note:** Very conservative - might want more aggressive driving in future

## Issues Found (Minimal Impact)

All issues are isolated single-sample glitches:

1. **episode_20251005_192655** - Row 197
   - Throttle period jumped to 11,172 Œºs (expected ~1,016)
   - Likely timer overflow
   - Impact: 0.25% of episode

2. **episode_20251006_215524** - Row 171
   - Throttle raw value spiked to 20,424 (2,010% duty!)
   - Sensor/ADC glitch
   - Impact: 0.25% of episode

3. **episode_20251006_215920** - Row 104
   - Steering value corrupted to 14,560,460 Œºs
   - Integer overflow/bit flip
   - Impact: 0.34% of episode

**These are typical hardware data acquisition artifacts and won't significantly affect training.**

## Recommendations

### For Training (Now)

**‚úÖ PROCEED WITH TRAINING** - Two options:

1. **Use data as-is (Recommended)**
   - Anomalies are <1% of data
   - Neural networks are robust to sparse outliers
   - Keeps maximum training samples

2. **Clean anomalies (Optional)**
   - Run: `python3 src/debug/clean_episode_data.py`
   - Removes 3 bad samples
   - Creates automatic backups

### For Future Data Collection

To improve data quality:
- ‚úÖ Add real-time validation in recorder (reject impossible values)
- ‚úÖ Implement median filtering (take 3 samples, use middle value)
- ‚úÖ Consider more aggressive throttle usage (explore full range)
- ‚úÖ Add Arduino-side data integrity checks

## Tools Created

Three new validation/analysis tools in `src/debug/`:

1. **`validate_episode_data.py`** - Comprehensive validation
   ```bash
   python3 src/debug/validate_episode_data.py
   ```

2. **`clean_episode_data.py`** - Remove anomalies (with backup)
   ```bash
   python3 src/debug/clean_episode_data.py
   ```

3. **`pwm_statistics.py`** - PWM distribution analysis
   ```bash
   python3 src/debug/pwm_statistics.py
   ```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Data validated** - No blocking issues found
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Proceed to training** - Data is ready to use
3. üîß **Optional cleanup** - Run clean script if desired
4. üìä **Monitor training** - Watch for any anomaly-related issues (unlikely)

---

**Bottom Line:** Your training data is high quality with excellent logging consistency. The PWM values are making sense and within expected ranges. The few anomalies found are negligible and won't impact training. You're good to go! üöÄ
