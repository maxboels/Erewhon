# ✅ State-Aware ACT Implementation - Summary

## 🎯 Problem Identified

Your original training scripts were **NOT using current state** (steering, throttle) as input to the model!

### What Was Wrong:
- `simple_act_trainer.py` - ❌ Image-only model
- `enhanced_act_trainer.py` - ❌ Image-only model  
- `test_inference.py` - ❌ Image-only inference

The dataset **provided** state information, but the model **wasn't using it**!

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Created **new state-aware implementation** that properly uses BOTH:
1. **Camera observations** (640×480 images)
2. **Current state** [steering, throttle]

### New Files:

1. **`state_aware_act_trainer.py`** - Training script
   - Model architecture with state encoder
   - Fusion of visual + state features
   - Proper data pipeline

2. **`state_aware_inference.py`** - Inference script
   - Automatic state tracking
   - Smooth control loop
   - Easy deployment

3. **`STATE_AWARE_TRAINING_GUIDE.md`** - Complete guide
   - Architecture explanation
   - Training instructions
   - Deployment guide

4. **`QUICK_COMMANDS.md`** - Quick reference
   - Training commands
   - Testing commands
   - Common workflows

5. **`STATE_INPUT_ANALYSIS.md`** - Technical analysis

## 🏗️ Model Architecture (New)

```
Input Layer:
├─ Camera Image [3, 480, 640]
└─ Current State [steering, throttle]
        ↓
Encoding:
├─ Vision Encoder (CNN) → [512]
└─ State Encoder (MLP)  → [128]
        ↓
Fusion:
└─ Concatenate + FC → [512]
        ↓
Transformer:
└─ Multi-head Attention → [512]
        ↓
Action Decoder:
└─ MLP → [chunk_size × 2]
        ↓
Output:
└─ Action Sequence [steering, throttle]
```

### Key Features:
- ✅ **Dual input**: Vision + State
- ✅ **Feature fusion**: Combines modalities
- ✅ **Temporal modeling**: Transformer encoder
- ✅ **Action chunking**: Predicts sequence for smoothness
- ✅ **Edge optimized**: ~6M parameters

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Train State-Aware Model

```bash
cd /home/maxboels/projects/Erewhon/src/policies/ACT

python3 state_aware_act_trainer.py \
  --data_dir /home/maxboels/projects/Erewhon/src/robots/rover/episodes \
  --max_epochs 50 \
  --batch_size 8 \
  --device cuda
```

**Expected output:**
```
🚀 Starting state-aware ACT training...
Model receives: Image (640x480) + Current State [steering, throttle]
Epoch 1/50 | Train Loss: 0.012 | Val Loss: 0.010
...
🎉 Training completed!
Best validation loss: 0.000123
```

### Step 2: Test Inference

```bash
python3 state_aware_inference.py \
  --model outputs/state_aware_act_XXXXXX/best_model.pth \
  --episode ../robots/rover/episodes/episode_20251007_144013 \
  --device cuda
```

**Expected output:**
```
🤖 State-Aware ACT Inference Test
Frame 1:
  Input State: S=0.0000, T=0.0000
  Predicted:   S=0.1234, T=0.2345
  Ground Truth: S=0.1200, T=0.2300
  Error: S=0.0034, T=0.0045
  
Average Errors:
  Steering: 0.0045
  Throttle: 0.0052
  
Performance:
  Avg inference: 1.23ms
  Avg FPS: 812.3
```

### Step 3: Deploy on RC Car

```python
from state_aware_inference import StateAwareInference
import cv2

# Load model
model = StateAwareInference('best_model.pth', device='cpu')

# Camera setup
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640)
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 480)

# Control loop
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    
    # Inference (state tracked internally)
    result = model.predict(frame)
    
    # Send to motors
    send_to_motors(
        steering=result['steering'],
        throttle=result['throttle']
    )
```

## 📊 Why State-Aware is Better

### Image-Only Model (OLD):
```python
# Only knows: "I see this road"
action = model(image)
# Problem: Doesn't know current speed, steering angle, momentum
```

### State-Aware Model (NEW):
```python
# Knows: "I see this road AND I'm currently doing this"
action = model(image, current_state)
# Better: Can make informed decisions based on full context
```

### Benefits:
1. ✅ **Smoother control** - Knows current momentum
2. ✅ **Better stability** - Understands vehicle state
3. ✅ **Temporal consistency** - Actions coherent over time
4. ✅ **Lag compensation** - Accounts for previous commands

## 🚨 Important Notes

### 1. **You MUST Retrain**
The old models (simple_act, enhanced_act) don't use state. You need to train a new model with `state_aware_act_trainer.py`.

### 2. **State Tracking is Automatic**
The `StateAwareInference` class tracks state internally. You just call `predict(image)`.

### 3. **Initial State is Neutral**
First inference uses [0.0, 0.0]. This is correct - the car should start from rest.

### 4. **State Propagates Through Time**
```
Frame 1: State=[0.0, 0.0] → Action=[0.1, 0.2]
Frame 2: State=[0.1, 0.2] → Action=[0.15, 0.25]  ← Uses previous action
Frame 3: State=[0.15, 0.25] → Action=[0.2, 0.3]
...
```

### 5. **Resolution Must Match**
Always use 640×480 for both training and inference (see `RESOLUTION_CONFIG.md`).

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Your state-aware ACT is working correctly if:

1. ✅ Training logs show "State-aware (image + current state)"
2. ✅ Validation loss < 0.001
3. ✅ Inference errors < 0.01 for steering and throttle
4. ✅ State progression is smooth (no jumps)
5. ✅ Control is smooth on RC car
6. ✅ Vehicle responds appropriately to visual input

---

## 🔗 Next Steps

1. **Train the state-aware model** using your episode data
2. **Test inference** on episode frames
3. **Verify state tracking** is smooth
4. **Deploy on Raspberry Pi 5** for real-time control
5. **Collect more data** if needed for better performance
6. **Consider SmolVLA** for vision-language control later

---

**Bottom Line:** Your RC car's brain now knows BOTH what it sees (camera) AND what it's doing (state). This is the correct way to train autonomous control! 🚗💨✨
