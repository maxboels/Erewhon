# ✅ ACTION REQUIRED: Switch to State-Aware Training

## 🎯 WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

Your ACT model training was **NOT using current vehicle state** (steering, throttle) as input!

This has been **FIXED** with new state-aware implementation.

---

## ⚡ WHAT TO DO NOW

### 1️⃣ **Stop Using Old Scripts**

❌ **DON'T USE:**
- `simple_act_trainer.py`
- `enhanced_act_trainer.py`
- `test_inference.py`

These are **image-only** and produce jerky control!

### 2️⃣ **Start Using New Scripts**

✅ **USE THESE:**
```bash
# Train (uses image + state)
python3 state_aware_act_trainer.py \
  --data_dir ../../robots/rover/episodes \
  --device cuda

# Inference (tracks state automatically)
python3 state_aware_inference.py \
  --model outputs/state_aware_act_XXX/best_model.pth \
  --episode ../../robots/rover/episodes/episode_XXX
```

---

## 📊 WHAT CHANGED

### Before (Image-Only) ❌
```
Input:  📷 Camera image only
Model:  "I see a road"
Output: 🎮 Action (jerky, unstable)
```

### After (State-Aware) ✅
```
Input:  📷 Camera image + 🎛️ Current state [steering, throttle]
Model:  "I see a road AND I'm doing this"
Output: 🎮 Smooth action (stable, consistent)
```

## 📁 NEW FILES CREATED

### Core Implementation:
1. **`state_aware_act_trainer.py`** - Training script
2. **`state_aware_inference.py`** - Inference script

### Documentation:
3. **`VISUAL_GUIDE.md`** - Visual explanation
4. **`STATE_AWARE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - Full summary
5. **`STATE_AWARE_TRAINING_GUIDE.md`** - Detailed guide
6. **`QUICK_COMMANDS.md`** - Command reference
7. **`STATE_INPUT_ANALYSIS.md`** - Technical analysis
8. **`RESOLUTION_CONFIG.md`** - Resolution config

---

## 🚀 QUICK START

### Train New Model:
```bash
cd /home/maxboels/projects/Erewhon/src/policies/ACT

python3 state_aware_act_trainer.py \
  --data_dir /home/maxboels/projects/Erewhon/src/robots/rover/episodes \
  --max_epochs 50 \
  --batch_size 8 \
  --device cuda
```

### Test Inference:
```bash
python3 state_aware_inference.py \
  --model outputs/state_aware_act_20251008_XXXXXX/best_model.pth \
  --episode ../../robots/rover/episodes/episode_20251007_144013 \
  --num_samples 20 \
  --device cuda
```

## ✅ VERIFY IT'S WORKING

Look for this in training output:
```
🤖 State-Aware ACT Training for RC Car
======================================
This model uses BOTH:
  ✅ Camera observations (640x480)
  ✅ Current state [steering, throttle]
======================================
```

## 📚 READ THESE (IN ORDER)

1. **Start here:** `VISUAL_GUIDE.md` - See what changed visually
2. **Then read:** `STATE_AWARE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Full summary
3. **For training:** `STATE_AWARE_TRAINING_GUIDE.md` - Detailed guide
4. **For commands:** `QUICK_COMMANDS.md` - Quick reference

---

## 🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS

### Image-Only Problems:
- 🔴 Model doesn't know current speed
- 🔴 Model doesn't know current steering
- 🔴 Results in jerky, unstable control
- 🔴 Can't anticipate vehicle dynamics

### State-Aware Benefits:
- ✅ Model knows full vehicle state
- ✅ Smooth, continuous control
- ✅ Better stability and consistency
- ✅ Temporal awareness

---

## 🚗 BOTTOM LINE

**Your model needs to know BOTH:**
1. What it sees (camera) 📷
2. What it's doing (state) 🎛️

**Just like a human driver needs BOTH vision AND feeling of the car!**
