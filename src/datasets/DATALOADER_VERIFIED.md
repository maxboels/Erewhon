## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Issue Found:
❌ **Before:** `observation.state` == `action` (same control sample)
- Model could just copy the state input
- Not learning temporal dynamics

### Issue Fixed:
✅ **After:** `observation.state` = previous action, `action` = current control
- Model learns proper temporal relationships
- State represents robot configuration at observation time
- Action represents what to do given current observation

### Code Changes:
```python
# OLD (incorrect):
state = action = [steering, throttle]  # Same!

# NEW (correct):
state = [prev_steering, prev_throttle]  # Where we WERE
action = [curr_steering, curr_throttle]  # What we DID
```

---

## ✅ Verification Results

### Test Output:
```
Sample 0 (first frame):
  State: [0.0000, 0.0000]  # Neutral (no previous action)
  Action: [0.0618, 0.0000] # First control

Sample 1:
  State: [0.0618, 0.0000]  # Previous action
  Action: [0.0623, 0.0000] # Current control
  ✅ State matches previous action (good!)

Sample 2:
  State: [0.0623, 0.0000]  # Previous action
  Action: [0.0541, 0.0000] # Current control
  ✅ State matches previous action (good!)
```

**Perfect! State[t] = Action[t-1]** ✅

## 📦 Data Flow

### Training Pipeline:
```
Episode Files
    ↓
TracerLocalDataset._load_episodes()
    ↓
_synchronize_episode()
    • Match frames with controls (< 50ms)
    • state[t] = action[t-1]
    • action[t] = control[t]
    ↓
__getitem__(idx)
    • Load image
    • Return LeRobot format:
      - observation.images.cam_front
      - observation.state (previous)
      - action (current)
    ↓
lerobot_collate_fn()
    • Batch samples
    • Add action_is_pad mask
    ↓
ACTPolicy.forward(batch)
    • Process with full LeRobot ACT
```

## 🎯 Sample Data Example

### From Episode `episode_20251007_153910`:
```json
{
  "episode_id": "episode_20251007_153910",
  "action_label": "hit red balloon",
  "duration": 6.1 seconds,
  "metadata": {
    "camera_fps": 30,
    "camera_resolution": [640, 360],
    "total_control_samples": 213,
    "total_frames": 176
  }
}
```

### Sample Synchronization:
```
Frame #1: t=1759847953.106766
  → Control: t=1759847953.107737
  → Δt = 1.0ms ✅
  → State: [0.0, 0.0] (neutral)
  → Action: [0.062, 0.0]

Frame #2: t=1759847953.141064
  → Control: t=1759847953.140671
  → Δt = 0.4ms ✅
  → State: [0.062, 0.0] (previous)
  → Action: [0.054, 0.0] (current)
```

## 🚀 Ready for Training!

### Training Command:
```bash
python src/policies/ACT/official_lerobot_trainer.py \
    --data_dir src/robots/rover/episodes \
    --output_dir ./outputs/lerobot_act \
    --epochs 100 \
    --batch_size 16 \
    --device cuda
```

### Expected Results:
- **Total samples:** 14,117
- **Episodes:** 88
- **Batch size:** 16
- **Steps per epoch:** ~882
- **Total steps:** ~88,200 (for 100 epochs)

### Model Input/Output:
```python
# Input
observation.images.cam_front: [B, 3, 360, 640]  # Camera
observation.state: [B, 2]                       # [prev_steering, prev_throttle]

# Output
action: [B, chunk_size, 2]                      # [curr_steering, curr_throttle] × 32
```

## 📝 Key Findings

### ✅ What Works:
1. **Data Quality:** Images are 640×360, good sync (<2ms avg)
2. **State/Action Separation:** Proper temporal relationship
3. **Episode Diversity:** 88 episodes of different maneuvers
4. **LeRobot Compatibility:** Batch format matches ACTPolicy expectations

### 📊 Dataset Statistics:
```
Total episodes: 88
Total samples: 14,117
Avg samples/episode: 160
Frame rate: ~29 FPS
Control rate: ~35 Hz
Sync tolerance: 50ms
Avg sync error: <2ms
```

### 🎓 Training Insights:
- First frame of each episode has neutral state [0,0]
- State provides context: "where the robot was"
- Action provides target: "what the robot did"
- Model learns: observation + state → action
